Description

As the first assignment for the Georgia Tech Web Development bootcamp I was tasked to refactor an existing website for a marketing agency. This "on the job" assignment would test my knowledge on HTML and CSS elements in theory as well as in practice. The existing code had some errors and non functioning links. Combing through these and cleaning the code was essential to creating a functioning and aesthetically pleasing website. One of the major areas of focus was accessibility. Using 'alt attributes' I prioritized the images in the HTML code to work with screen readers like VoiceOver. 

Refactoring this code provided me the opportunity to gain further comfort with syntax and use of semantic code. Really paying attention to details and focusing on formatting allowed me to put comments throughout the code to help the next developer (the scout rule).

The most challenging part of this refactor was restructuring the navigation bar. I battled with floats and other positioning elements for a while before I came to the realization a little change within the CSS document would display the nav properly for me. 

This assignment has pushed me to dive deeper into accessibility code and standards. The advantage and protection you can gain when making your website accessible is important on so many levels. As a first project, I am grateful for this experience as it has challenged me in such a way that has brought me a sense of accomplishment throughout the journey as opposed to just arriving to a finishing point. 

I look forward to my continued growth. Thank you.
